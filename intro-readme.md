- 👋 Hi, I’m @mxfactotum
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better engiener. I created this Git 2 years ago with the hope I would practice everyday. Life got in the way. 
- Now I'm back and hoping to use this space more frequently. More to come!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash Scripting and Linux Command Line.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything! I'm very intellecutually curious; if you can teach it, I can learn it! 
- 📫 I'm still deciding on what the best way to reach me is. More to come.
